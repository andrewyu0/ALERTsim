However, given the highly competitive nature of the Angolan oil and gas market, we need to act swiftly to secure these contracts. Providing a detailed breakdown and obtaining a written opinion from legal experts may delay our efforts and put our market position at risk. As an alternative, I propose that we closely monitor the sales commission distribution and maintain clear documentation of all transactions. Additionally, we can have regular internal audits to ensure compliance with both U.S. and Angolan laws and Silvercrest's ethical guidelines.
